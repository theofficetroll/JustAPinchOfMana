# JustAPinchOfMana

Just A Pinch of Mana is a clicker style game inspired by my memories of Get A Little Gold, which ended with the death of Flash.
It is a basic "make numbers get big" clicker with three layers of purchaseable upgrades planned and multiple styles of runs to be unlockable.
The runs are designed to be caterable to the time commitment and complexity desired by the player.

Home is the basic starting point of the game. From here a player may purchase upgrades with Mana Shards, start new Runs, and Ascend, gaining Essense Shards.

Run is where the game is actively played.


# Run Components

Run itself holds the primary Hooks, controls game state, etc.

Progress shows the current mana held by the player and/ or other goals. Contains button to trigger end-run in some types of Run.

Build shows current tool data and allows player to purchase tools.

Research displays new tools, spells, and upgrades available to the player.

Orb can be clicked by the player to provide mana. Visually "fills" as the player gets closer to goal in Runs where that matters.

Tools holds visual representations of the tools being utilized by the player. Should get busier as more tools are added.
